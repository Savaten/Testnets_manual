Hardware Requirements

Like any Cosmos-SDK chain, the hardware requirements are pretty modest.

Minimum Hardware Requirements

3x CPUs; the faster clock speed the better
4GB RAM
80GB Disk
Permanent Internet connection (traffic will be minimal during testnet; 10Mbps will be plenty - for production at least 100Mbps is expected)
Recommended Hardware Requirements

4x CPUs; the faster clock speed the better
8GB RAM
200GB of storage (SSD or NVME)
Permanent Internet connection (traffic will be minimal during testnet; 10Mbps will be plenty - for production at least 100Mbps is expected)
Set up your uptick fullnode

Option 1 (automatic)

You can setup your uptick fullnode in few minutes by using automated script below. It will prompt you to input your validator node name!

wget -O uptick.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kj89/testnet_manuals/main/uptick/uptick.sh && chmod +x uptick.sh && ./uptick.sh
Option 2 (manual)

You can follow manual guide if you better prefer setting up node manually

Post installation

When installation is finished please load variables into system

source $HOME/.bash_profile
Next you have to make sure your validator is syncing blocks. You can use command below to check synchronization status

uptickd status 2>&1 | jq .SyncInfo
(OPTIONAL) State Sync

You can state sync your node in minutes by running commands below. Special thanks to polkachu | polkachu.com#1249

N/A
Create wallet

To create new wallet you can use command below. Donâ€™t forget to save the mnemonic

uptickd keys add $WALLET
(OPTIONAL) To recover your wallet using seed phrase

uptickd keys add $WALLET --recover
To get current list of wallets

uptickd keys list
Save wallet info

Add wallet and valoper address and load variables into the system

UPTICK_WALLET_ADDRESS=$(uptickd keys show $WALLET -a)
UPTICK_VALOPER_ADDRESS=$(uptickd keys show $WALLET --bech val -a)
echo 'export UPTICK_WALLET_ADDRESS='${UPTICK_WALLET_ADDRESS} >> $HOME/.bash_profile
echo 'export UPTICK_VALOPER_ADDRESS='${UPTICK_VALOPER_ADDRESS} >> $HOME/.bash_profile
source $HOME/.bash_profile
Fund your wallet

In order to create validator first you need to fund your wallet with testnet tokens. To top up your wallet join Uptick discord server and navigate to #faucet channel

To request a faucet grant:

$faucet <YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS>
Create validator

Before creating validator please make sure that you have at least 1 uptick (1 uptick is equal to 1000000000000000000 auptick) and your node is synchronized

To check your wallet balance:

uptickd query bank balances $UPTICK_WALLET_ADDRESS
If your wallet does not show any balance than probably your node is still syncing. Please wait until it finish to synchronize and then continue
To create your validator run command below

uptickd tx staking create-validator \
  --amount 5000000000000000000auptick \
  --from $WALLET \
  --commission-max-change-rate "0.01" \
  --commission-max-rate "0.2" \
  --commission-rate "0.07" \
  --min-self-delegation "1" \
  --pubkey  $(uptickd tendermint show-validator) \
  --moniker $NODENAME \
  --chain-id $UPTICK_CHAIN_ID \
  --gas=auto
Security

To protect you keys please make sure you follow basic security rules

Set up ssh keys for authentication

Good tutorial on how to set up ssh keys for authentication to your server can be found here

Basic Firewall security

Start by checking the status of ufw.

sudo ufw status
Sets the default to allow outgoing connections, deny all incoming except ssh and 26656. Limit SSH login attempts

sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw allow ssh/tcp
sudo ufw limit ssh/tcp
sudo ufw allow ${UPTICK_PORT}656,${UPTICK_PORT}660/tcp
sudo ufw enable
Monitoring

To monitor and get alerted about your validator health status you can use my guide on Set up monitoring and alerting for uptick validator

Calculate synchronization time

This script will help you to estimate how much time it will take to fully synchronize your node
It measures average blocks per minute that are being synchronized for period of 5 minutes and then gives you results

wget -O synctime.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kj89/testnet_manuals/main/uptick/tools/synctime.py && python3 ./synctime.py
Get list of validators

uptickd q staking validators -oj --limit=3000 | jq '.validators[] | select(.status=="BOND_STATUS_BONDED")' | jq -r '(.tokens|tonumber/pow(10; 6)|floor|tostring) + " \t " + .description.moniker' | sort -gr | nl
Get currently connected peer list with ids

curl -sS http://localhost:${UPTICK_PORT}657/net_info | jq -r '.result.peers[] | "\(.node_info.id)@\(.remote_ip):\(.node_info.listen_addr)"' | awk -F ':' '{print $1":"$(NF)}'
